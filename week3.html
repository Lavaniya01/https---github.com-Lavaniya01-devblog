</head>

  <body>
   <h1>Week 3 blog</h1>
   <p>This is week 3. By doing the CAs, I learned how to create forms with radio buttons, date, time, check box, text area as well as add a submit button. I also learned how to do 
    absolute and relative positioning as well as flexboxes. During the flexboxes practice, I learned how to change the screen size using media screen code. 
    I also leanred how to use the css file to style the html page like adding colours as well change the width.

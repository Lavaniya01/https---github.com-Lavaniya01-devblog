   <h1>Week 8 blog</h1>
   <p>This is week 8. By doing the CAs, I learned about data attributes and fetch api. Data attributes are special attributes in HTML that allow you to store extra information directly in your HTML elements.
    The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface that allows you to make network requests (like fetching data from a server) in a more flexible and powerful way.

   <h1>Week 7 blog</h1>
   <p>This is week 7. I learned about DOM, event handling and validation and JSON local storage. The DOM is like a tree structure that represents a web page.
    Event handling is about making your webpage respond to actions performed by the user or the browser. Validation ensures that the data entered by users on your webpage is correct and meets certain criteria. 
    You can use JSON to structure and store data, and local storage to save that data on the user's device, making it available even if they close and reopen the browser.
